# Plane wave propagation in a plasma (1D FDTD)
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the 1D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulating the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in a plasma medium. The FDTD method is a powerful and widely used numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in the time domain, particularly suited for studying wave interactions with complex media like plasmas.

Features
* 1D FDTD Simulation: Implements a one-dimensional FDTD algorithm to simulate plane wave propagation in a plasma.
* Plasma Medium Modeling: Accurately models the dispersive properties of plasma, including the effects of plasma frequency and collision frequency.
* User-Friendly MATLAB Code: Provides clear, well-documented MATLAB scripts that are easy to understand and modify.
* Visualization Tools: Includes functions to visualize electric and magnetic field distributions over time, enabling detailed analysis of wave behavior in plasma.
* Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time steps, plasma density, and wave properties.
